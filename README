NLP Assignment 2

To run my program, first open it in google collab and upload the file called glove.6B.100d.txt. This file is included in my submission and contains the pretrained embedding needed for Part 3 of the assignment. Then, run each code section individually below the text labelled 'Setup', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Training Batch Size', and 'Part 1'. This will load and preprocess the movie reviews in a training, validation, and test set as well as build and evaluate the SimpleRNN model for Part 1. 

Then, if you want to run my code for Part 2, change the value of the batch size in the first code section under 'Training Batch Size' to 512 for best results. Then, run each code section individually under the text labelled 'Training Batch Size' and 'Part 2'. This will build and evaluate the GRU model. Note that the glove.6B.100d.txt file must be uploaded for this to work.

Then, if you want to run my code for Part 3, change the value of the batch size in the first code section under 'Training Batch Size' to 16 for best results. Then, run each code section individually under the text labelled 'Training Batch Size' and 'Part 3'. This will build and evaluate the GRU model using pretrained embeddings. 

Some code for this section was taken from https://medium.com/@sabber/classifying-yelp-review-comments-using-cnn-lstm-and-pre-trained-glove-word-embeddings-part-3-53fcea9a17fa

The pretrained embeddings are from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove
